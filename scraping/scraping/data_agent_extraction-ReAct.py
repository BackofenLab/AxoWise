    prompt = f"""
        You are a highly precise extraction tool. I will provide you with a scientific text and you have to extract source code and sequencing data URLs, and accession codes for sequencing data from it.
        Your task:
        1. Extract **only** explicitly stated sequencing data accession codes and their respective database names (e.g., GEO, ENA, SRA, etc.). Do **not** infer or guess accession codes if they are not explicitly mentioned in the text.
        2. Identify **all** source code URLs, including URLs from **GitHub** and **Zenodo**. For Zenodo, include any URL explicitly mentioned, regardless of whether it refers to sequencing data or source code.

        Return the results **only** in valid JSON format, with no additional text or explanation. Do **not** include any introductory or closing statements.

        The returned JSON should strictly follow the following format:
        {{
            "accession codes": {{
                "database_name_1": ["accession_code_1", "accession_code_2"],
                "database_name_2": ["accession_code_3"]
            }},
            "source code": ["GitHub_URL", "Zenodo_URL"]
        }}

        Example Input:
        <<DATA>> Raw sequencing data were deposited at the GEO under accession numbers GSE12345 and GSE67890. Sequencing data is available on Zenodo at https://zenodo.org/record/12345 and https://doi.org/10.1010/zenodo.1234567. 
        Additional analysis scripts are hosted on Zenodo at https://zenodo.org/record/67890 and GitHub at https://github.com/example/repo. The following open-source code and databases were used in this article: JaBbA (v.1.1) (https://github.com/mskilab/JaBbA), 
        gGnome (commit c390d80) (https://github.com/mskilab/gGnome), AmpliconArchitect (https://github.com/virajbdeshpande/AmpliconArchitect) <<END DATA>>

        Strict Rules:
        - Only return the JSON structure as shown, with **no additional text or explanation**.
        - If no accession codes are available, leave the "accession codes" section empty: "accession codes": {{}}.
        - If no source code URLs are available, leave the "source code" section empty: "source code": [].
        - Accession codes must strictly follow common formats (e.g., GSE followed by numbers for GEO, PRJ followed by alphanumeric strings for SRA, etc.). **Only include accession codes that match valid formats**.
        - Include **all Zenodo URLs** explicitly mentioned in the text, regardless of their stated purpose, and ensure that **no other URLs** (except GitHub or Zenodo) are included in the "source code" section. Do **NOT** include URLs related to libraries or softwares used.
